<p class="speech"><span class="direction">[Smiling.]</span> Now you mustn't think that Thomas and I are
  spendthrifts.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="direction">[bowing a little distantly.]</span> Good evening. You have
  come on business, no doubt.</p>


<h6 class="Hovstad"> HOVSTAD.</h6>

<p class="speech"> Yes, I hope you will forgive me, but I was delayed at the

  persuade him to come up!</p>

<h6 class="Billing"> BILLING.</h6>

<p class="speech"> That is just what it is! That word sums up the situation.</p>


<h6 class="Horster"> HORSTER </h6>

<p> We must remember that Peter is a lonely man, poor chap.He has no home comforts of any kind; nothing but everlasting business.
  And all that infernal weak tea wash that he pours into himself! Now then, my boys, bring chairs up to the table. Aren't we going to have
  that toddy, Katherine?</p>

  mix it too strong. But I forgot, father—I have a letter for you.<span class="direction">[Goes to the chair where she has laid her things.]</span></p>
