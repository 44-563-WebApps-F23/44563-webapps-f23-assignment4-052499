    <p>(SCENE.—The editorial office of the "People's Messenger." The entrance
        door is on the left-hand side of the back wall; on the right-hand side
        is another door with glass panels through which the printing room can
        be seen. Another door in the right-hand wall. In the middle of the room
        is a large table covered with papers, newspapers and books. In the
        foreground on the left a window, before which stands a desk and a high
        stool. There are a couple of easy chairs by the table, and other chairs
        standing along the wall. The room is dingy and uncomfortable; the
        furniture is old, the chairs stained and torn. In the printing room the
        compositors are seen at work, and a printer is working a handpress.
        HOVSTAD is sitting at the desk, writing. BILLING comes in from the
        right with DR. STOCKMANN'S manuscript in his hand.)
        
        Billing. Well, I must say!
        
        Hovstad (still writing). Have you read it through?
        
        Billing (laying the MS. on the desk). Yes, indeed I have.
        
        Hovstad. Don't you think the Doctor hits them pretty hard?
        
        Billing. Hard? Bless my soul, he's crushing! Every word falls like—how
        shall I put it?—like the blow of a sledgehammer.
        
        Hovstad. Yes, but they are not the people to throw up the sponge at the
        first blow.
        
        Billing. That is true; and for that reason we must strike blow upon
        blow until the whole of this aristocracy tumbles to pieces. As I sat in
        there reading this, I almost seemed to see a revolution in being.
        
        Hovstad (turning round). Hush!—Speak so that Aslaksen cannot hear you.
        
        Billing (lowering his voice). Aslaksen is a chicken-hearted chap, a
        coward; there is nothing of the man in him. But this time you will
        insist on your own way, won't you? You will put the Doctor's article in?
        
        Hovstad. Yes, and if the Mayor doesn't like it—
        
        Billing. That will be the devil of a nuisance.
        
        Hovstad. Well, fortunately we can turn the situation to good account,
        whatever happens. If the Mayor will not fall in with the Doctor's
        project, he will have all the small tradesmen down on him—the whole of
        the Householders' Association and the rest of them. And if he does fall
        in with it, he will fall out with the whole crowd of large shareholders
        in the Baths, who up to now have been his most valuable supporters—
        
        Billing. Yes, because they will certainly have to fork out a pretty
        penny—
        
        Hovstad. Yes, you may be sure they will. And in this way the ring will
        be broken up, you see, and then in every issue of the paper we will
        enlighten the public on the Mayor's incapability on one point and
        another, and make it clear that all the positions of trust in the town,
        the whole control of municipal affairs, ought to be put in the hands of
        the Liberals.
        
        Billing. That is perfectly true! I see it coming—I see it coming; we
        are on the threshold of a revolution!
        
        (A knock is heard at the door.)
        
        Hovstad. Hush! (Calls out.) Come in! (DR. STOCKMANN comes in by the
        street door. HOVSTAD goes to meet him.) Ah, it is you, Doctor! Well?
        
        Dr. Stockmann. You may set to work and print it, Mr. Hovstad!
        
        Hovstad. Has it come to that, then?
        
        Billing. Hurrah!
        
        Dr. Stockmann. Yes, print away. Undoubtedly it has come to that. Now
        they must take what they get. There is going to be a fight in the town,
        Mr. Billing!
        
        Billing. War to the knife, I hope! We will get our knives to their
        throats, Doctor!
        
        Dr. Stockmann. This article is only a beginning. I have already got
        four or five more sketched out in my head. Where is Aslaksen?
        
        Billing (calls into the printing-room). Aslaksen, just come here for a
        minute!
        
        Hovstad. Four or five more articles, did you say? On the same subject?
        
        Dr. Stockmann. No—far from it, my dear fellow. No, they are about
        quite another matter. But they all spring from the question of the
        water supply and the drainage. One thing leads to another, you know. It
        is like beginning to pull down an old house, exactly.
        
        Billing. Upon my soul, it's true; you find you are not done till you
        have pulled all the old rubbish down.
        
        Aslaksen (coming in). Pulled down? You are not thinking of pulling down
        the Baths surely, Doctor?
        
        Hovstad. Far from it, don't be afraid.
        
        Dr. Stockmann. No, we meant something quite different. Well, what do
        you think of my article, Mr. Hovstad?
        
        Hovstad. I think it is simply a masterpiece.
        
        Dr. Stockmann. Do you really think so? Well, I am very pleased, very
        pleased.
        
        Hovstad. It is so clear and intelligible. One need have no special
        knowledge to understand the bearing of it. You will have every
        enlightened man on your side.
        
        Aslaksen. And every prudent man too, I hope?
        
        Billing. The prudent and the imprudent—almost the whole town.
        
        Aslaksen. In that case we may venture to print it.
        
        Dr. Stockmann. I should think so!
        
        Hovstad. We will put it in tomorrow morning.
        
        Dr. Stockmann. Of course—you must not lose a single day. What I wanted
        to ask you, Mr. Aslaksen, was if you would supervise the printing of it
        yourself.
        
        Aslaksen. With pleasure.
        
        Dr. Stockmann. Take care of it as if it were a treasure! No
        misprints—every word is important. I will look in again a little
        later; perhaps you will be able to let me see a proof. I can't tell you
        how eager I am to see it in print, and see it burst upon the public—
        
        Billing. Burst upon them—yes, like a flash of lightning!
        
        Dr. Stockmann. —and to have it submitted to the judgment of my
        intelligent fellow townsmen. You cannot imagine what I have gone
        through today. I have been threatened first with one thing and then
        with another; they have tried to rob me of my most elementary rights as
        a man—
        
        Billing. What! Your rights as a man!
        
        Dr. Stockmann. —they have tried to degrade me, to make a coward of me,
        to force me to put personal interests before my most sacred convictions.
        
        Billing. That is too much—I'm damned if it isn't.
        
        Hovstad. Oh, you mustn't be surprised at anything from that quarter.
        
        Dr. Stockmann. Well, they will get the worst of it with me; they may
        assure themselves of that. I shall consider the "People's Messenger" my
        sheet-anchor now, and every single day I will bombard them with one
        article after another, like bombshells—
        
        Aslaksen. Yes, but
        
        Billing. Hurrah!—it is war, it is war!
        
        Dr. Stockmann. I shall smite them to the ground—I shall crush them—I
        shall break down all their defenses, before the eyes of the honest
        public! That is what I shall do!
        
        Aslaksen, Yes, but in moderation, Doctor—proceed with moderation.
        
        Billing. Not a bit of it, not a bit of it! Don't spare the dynamite!
        
        Dr. Stockmann. Because it is not merely a question of water-supply and
        drains now, you know. No—it is the whole of our social life that we
        have got to purify and disinfect—
        
        Billing. Spoken like a deliverer!
        
        Dr. Stockmann. All the incapables must be turned out, you
        understand—and that in every walk of life! Endless vistas have opened
        themselves to my mind's eye today. I cannot see it all quite clearly
        yet, but I shall in time. Young and vigorous standard-bearers—those
        are what we need and must seek, my friends; we must have new men in
        command at all our outposts.
        
        Billing. Hear hear!
        
        Dr. Stockmann. We only need to stand by one another, and it will all be
        perfectly easy. The revolution will be launched like a ship that runs
        smoothly off the stocks. Don't you think so?
        
        Hovstad. For my part I think we have now a prospect of getting the
        municipal authority into the hands where it should lie.
        
        Aslaksen. And if only we proceed with moderation, I cannot imagine that
        there will be any risk.
        
        Dr. Stockmann. Who the devil cares whether there is any risk or not!
        What I am doing, I am doing in the name of truth and for the sake of my
        conscience.
        
        Hovstad. You are a man who deserves to be supported, Doctor.
        
        Aslaksen. Yes, there is no denying that the Doctor is a true friend to
        the town—a real friend to the community, that he is.
        
        Billing. Take my word for it, Aslaksen, Dr. Stockmann is a friend of
        the people.
        
        Aslaksen. I fancy the Householders' Association will make use of that
        expression before long.
        
        Dr. Stockmann (affected, grasps their hands). Thank you, thank you, my
        dear staunch friends. It is very refreshing to me to hear you say that;
        my brother called me something quite different. By Jove, he shall have
        it back, with interest! But now I must be off to see a poor devil—I
        will come back, as I said. Keep a very careful eye on the manuscript,
        Aslaksen, and don't for worlds leave out any of my notes of
        exclamation! Rather put one or two more in! Capital, capital! Well,
        good-bye for the present—goodbye, goodbye! (They show him to the door,
        and bow him out.)
        
        Hovstad. He may prove an invaluably useful man to us.
        
        Aslaksen. Yes, so long as he confines himself to this matter of the
        Baths. But if he goes farther afield, I don't think it would be
        advisable to follow him.
        
        Hovstad. Hm!—that all depends—
        
        Billing. You are so infernally timid, Aslaksen!
        
        Aslaksen. Timid? Yes, when it is a question of the local authorities, I
        am timid, Mr. Billing; it is a lesson I have learned in the school of
        experience, let me tell you. But try me in higher politics, in matters
        that concern the government itself, and then see if I am timid.
        
        Billing. No, you aren't, I admit. But this is simply contradicting
        yourself.
        
        Aslaksen. I am a man with a conscience, and that is the whole matter.
        If you attack the government, you don't do the community any harm,
        anyway; those fellows pay no attention to attacks, you see—they go on
        just as they are, in spite of them. But local authorities are
        different; they can be turned out, and then perhaps you may get an
        ignorant lot into office who may do irreparable harm to the
        householders and everybody else.
        
        Hovstad. But what of the education of citizens by self
        government—don't you attach any importance to that?
        
        Aslaksen. When a man has interests of his own to protect, he cannot
        think of everything, Mr. Hovstad.
        
        Hovstad. Then I hope I shall never have interests of my own to protect!
        
        Billing. Hear, hear!
        
        Aslaksen (with a smile). Hm! (Points to the desk.) Mr. Sheriff
        Stensgaard was your predecessor at that editorial desk.
        
        Billing (spitting). Bah! That turncoat.
        
        Hovstad. I am not a weathercock—and never will be.
        
        Aslaksen. A politician should never be too certain of anything, Mr.
        Hovstad. And as for you, Mr. Billing, I should think it is time for you
        to be taking in a reef or two in your sails, seeing that you are
        applying for the post of secretary to the Bench.
        
        Billing. I—!
        
        Hovstad. Are you, Billing?
        
        Billing. Well, yes—but you must clearly understand I am only doing it
        to annoy the bigwigs.
        
        Aslaksen. Anyhow, it is no business of mine. But if I am to be accused
        of timidity and of inconsistency in my principles, this is what I want
        to point out: my political past is an open book. I have never changed,
        except perhaps to become a little more moderate, you see. My heart is
        still with the people; but I don't deny that my reason has a certain
        bias towards the authorities—the local ones, I mean. (Goes into the
        printing room.)
        
        Billing. Oughtn't we to try and get rid of him, Hovstad?
        
        Hovstad. Do you know anyone else who will advance the money for our
        paper and printing bill?
        
        Billing. It is an infernal nuisance that we don't possess some capital
        to trade on.
        
        Hovstad (sitting down at his desk). Yes, if we only had that, then—
        
        Billing. Suppose you were to apply to Dr. Stockmann?
        
        Hovstad (turning over some papers). What is the use? He has got nothing.
        
        Billing. No, but he has got a warm man in the background, old Morten
        Kiil—"the Badger," as they call him.
        
        Hovstad (writing). Are you so sure he has got anything?
        
        Billing. Good Lord, of course he has! And some of it must come to the
        Stockmanns. Most probably he will do something for the children, at all
        events.
        
        Hovstad (turning half round). Are you counting on that?
        
        Billing. Counting on it? Of course I am not counting on anything.
        
        Hovstad. That is right. And I should not count on the secretaryship to
        the Bench either, if I were you; for I can assure you—you won't get it.
        
        Billing. Do you think I am not quite aware of that? My object is
        precisely not to get it. A slight of that kind stimulates a man's
        fighting power—it is like getting a supply of fresh bile—and I am
        sure one needs that badly enough in a hole-and-corner place like this,
        where it is so seldom anything happens to stir one up.
        
        Hovstad (writing). Quite so, quite so.
        
        Billing. Ah, I shall be heard of yet!—Now I shall go and write the
        appeal to the Householders' Association. (Goes into the room on the
        right.)
        
        Hovstad (sitting al his desk, biting his penholder, says slowly).
        Hm!—that's it, is it. (A knock is heard.) Come in! (PETRA comes in by
        the outer door. HOVSTAD gets up.) What, you!—here?
        
        Petra. Yes, you must forgive me—
        
        Hovstad (pulling a chair forward). Won't you sit down?
        
        Petra. No, thank you; I must go again in a moment.
        
        Hovstad. Have you come with a message from your father, by any chance?
        
        Petra. No, I have come on my own account. (Takes a book out of her coat
        pocket.) Here is the English story.
        
        Hovstad. Why have you brought it back?
        
        Petra. Because I am not going to translate it.
        
        Hovstad. But you promised me faithfully.
        
        Petra. Yes, but then I had not read it, I don't suppose you have read
        it either?
        
        Hovstad. No, you know quite well I don't understand English; but—
        
        Petra. Quite so. That is why I wanted to tell you that you must find
        something else. (Lays the book on the table.) You can't use this for
        the "People's Messenger."
        
        Hovstad. Why not?
        
        Petra. Because it conflicts with all your opinions.
        
        Hovstad. Oh, for that matter—
        
        Petra. You don't understand me. The burden of this story is that there
        is a supernatural power that looks after the so-called good people in
        this world and makes everything happen for the best in their
        case—while all the so-called bad people are punished.
        
        Hovstad. Well, but that is all right. That is just what our readers
        want.
        
        Petra. And are you going to be the one to give it to them? For myself,
        I do not believe a word of it. You know quite well that things do not
        happen so in reality.
        
        Hovstad. You are perfectly right; but an editor cannot always act as he
        would prefer. He is often obliged to bow to the wishes of the public in
        unimportant matters. Politics are the most important thing in life—for
        a newspaper, anyway; and if I want to carry my public with me on the
        path that leads to liberty and progress, I must not frighten them away.
        If they find a moral tale of this sort in the serial at the bottom of
        the page, they will be all the more ready to read what is printed above
        it; they feel more secure, as it were.
        
        Petra. For shame! You would never go and set a snare like that for your
        readers; you are not a spider!
        
        Hovstad (smiling). Thank you for having such a good opinion of me. No;
        as a matter of fact that is Billing's idea and not mine.
        
        Petra. Billing's!
        
        Hovstad. Yes; anyway, he propounded that theory here one day. And it is
        Billing who is so anxious to have that story in the paper; I don't know
        anything about the book.
        
        Petra. But how can Billing, with his emancipated views—
        
        Hovstad. Oh, Billing is a many-sided man. He is applying for the post
        of secretary to the Bench, too, I hear.
        
        Petra. I don't believe it, Mr. Hovstad. How could he possibly bring
        himself to do such a thing?
        
        Hovstad. Ah, you must ask him that.
        
        Petra. I should never have thought it of him.
        
        Hovstad (looking more closely at her). No? Does it really surprise you
        so much?
        
        Petra. Yes. Or perhaps not altogether. Really, I don't quite know
        
        Hovstad. We journalists are not much worth, Miss Stockmann.
        
        Petra. Do you really mean that?
        
        Hovstad. I think so sometimes.
        
        Petra. Yes, in the ordinary affairs of everyday life, perhaps; I can
        understand that. But now, when you have taken a weighty matter in hand—
        
        Hovstad. This matter of your father's, you mean?
        
        Petra. Exactly. It seems to me that now you must feel you are a man
        worth more than most.
        
        Hovstad. Yes, today I do feel something of that sort.
        
        Petra. Of course you do, don't you? It is a splendid vocation you have
        chosen—to smooth the way for the march of unappreciated truths, and
        new and courageous lines of thought. If it were nothing more than
        because you stand fearlessly in the open and take up the cause of an
        injured man—
        
        Hovstad. Especially when that injured man is—ahem!—I don't rightly
        know how to—
        
        Petra. When that man is so upright and so honest, you mean?
        
        Hovstad (more gently). Especially when he is your father I meant.
        
        Petra (suddenly checked). That?
        
        Hovstad. Yes, Petra—Miss Petra.
        
        Petra. Is it that, that is first and foremost with you? Not the matter
        itself? Not the truth?—not my father's big generous heart?
        
        Hovstad. Certainly—of course—that too.
        
        Petra. No, thank you; you have betrayed yourself, Mr. Hovstad, and now
        I shall never trust you again in anything.
        
        Hovstad. Can you really take it so amiss in me that it is mostly for
        your sake—?
        
        Petra. What I am angry with you for, is for not having been honest with
        my father. You talked to him as if the truth and the good of the
        community were what lay nearest to your heart. You have made fools of
        both my father and me. You are not the man you made yourself out to be.
        And that I shall never forgive you-never!
        
        Hovstad. You ought not to speak so bitterly, Miss Petra—least of all
        now.
        
        Petra. Why not now, especially?
        
        Hovstad. Because your father cannot do without my help.
        
        Petra (looking him up and down). Are you that sort of man too? For
        shame!
        
        Hovstad. No, no, I am not. This came upon me so unexpectedly—you must
        believe that.
        
        Petra. I know what to believe. Goodbye.
        
        Aslaksen (coming from the printing room, hurriedly and with an air of
        mystery). Damnation, Hovstad!—(Sees PETRA.) Oh, this is awkward—
        
        Petra. There is the book; you must give it to some one else. (Goes
        towards the door.)
        
        Hovstad (following her). But, Miss Stockmann—
        
        Petra. Goodbye. (Goes out.)
        
        Aslaksen. I say—Mr. Hovstad—
        
        Hovstad. Well well!—what is it?
        
        Aslaksen. The Mayor is outside in the printing room.
        
        Hovstad. The Mayor, did you say?
        
        Aslaksen. Yes he wants to speak to you. He came in by the back
        door—didn't want to be seen, you understand.
        
        Hovstad. What can he want? Wait a bit—I will go myself. (Goes to the
        door of the printing room, opens it, bows and invites PETER STOCKMANN
        in.) Just see, Aslaksen, that no one—
        
        Aslaksen. Quite so. (Goes into the printing-room.)
        
        Peter Stockmann. You did not expect to see me here, Mr. Hovstad?
        
        Hovstad. No, I confess I did not.
        
        Peter Stockmann (looking round). You are very snug in here—very nice
        indeed.
        
        Hovstad. Oh—
        
        Peter Stockmann. And here I come, without any notice, to take up your
        time!
        
        Hovstad. By all means, Mr. Mayor. I am at your service. But let me
        relieve you of your—(takes STOCKMANN's hat and stick and puts them on
        a chair). Won't you sit down?
        
        Peter Stockmann (sitting down by the table). Thank you. (HOVSTAD sits
        down.) I have had an extremely annoying experience to-day, Mr. Hovstad.
        
        Hovstad. Really? Ah well, I expect with all the various business you
        have to attend to—
        
        Peter Stockmann. The Medical Officer of the Baths is responsible for
        what happened today.
        
        Hovstad. Indeed? The Doctor?
        
        Peter Stockmann. He has addressed a kind of report to the Baths
        Committee on the subject of certain supposed defects in the Baths.
        
        Hovstad. Has he indeed?
        
        Peter Stockmann. Yes—has he not told you? I thought he said—
        
        Hovstad. Ah, yes—it is true he did mention something about—
        
        Aslaksen (coming from the printing-room). I ought to have that copy.
        
        Hovstad (angrily). Ahem!—there it is on the desk.
        
        Aslaksen (taking it). Right.
        
        Peter Stockmann. But look there—that is the thing I was speaking of!
        
        Aslaksen. Yes, that is the Doctor's article, Mr. Mayor.
        
        Hovstad. Oh, is THAT what you were speaking about?
        
        Peter Stockmann. Yes, that is it. What do you think of it?
        
        Hovstad. Oh, I am only a layman—and I have only taken a very cursory
        glance at it.
        
        Peter Stockmann. But you are going to print it?
        
        Hovstad. I cannot very well refuse a distinguished man.
        
        Aslaksen. I have nothing to do with editing the paper, Mr. Mayor—
        
        Peter Stockmann. I understand.
        
        Aslaksen. I merely print what is put into my hands.
        
        Peter Stockmann. Quite so.
        
        Aslaksen. And so I must— (moves off towards the printing-room).
        
        Peter Stockmann. No, but wait a moment, Mr. Aslaksen. You will allow
        me, Mr. Hovstad?
        
        Hovstad. If you please, Mr. Mayor.
        
        Peter Stockmann. You are a discreet and thoughtful man, Mr. Aslaksen.
        
        Aslaksen. I am delighted to hear you think so, sir.
        
        Peter Stockmann. And a man of very considerable influence.
        
        Aslaksen. Chiefly among the small tradesmen, sir.
        
        Peter Stockmann. The small tax-payers are the majority—here as
        everywhere else.
        
        Aslaksen. That is true.
        
        Peter Stockmann. And I have no doubt you know the general trend of
        opinion among them, don't you?
        
        Aslaksen. Yes I think I may say I do, Mr. Mayor.
        
        Peter Stockmann. Yes. Well, since there is such a praiseworthy spirit
        of self-sacrifice among the less wealthy citizens of our town—
        
        Aslaksen. What?
        
        Hovstad. Self-sacrifice?
        
        Peter Stockmann. It is pleasing evidence of a public-spirited feeling,
        extremely pleasing evidence. I might almost say I hardly expected it.
        But you have a closer knowledge of public opinion than I.
        
        Aslaksen. But, Mr. Mayor—
        
        Peter Stockmann. And indeed it is no small sacrifice that the town is
        going to make.
        
        Hovstad. The town?
        
        Aslaksen. But I don't understand. Is it the Baths—?
        
        Peter Stockmann. At a provisional estimate, the alterations that the
        Medical Officer asserts to be desirable will cost somewhere about
        twenty thousand pounds.
        
        Aslaksen. That is a lot of money, but—
        
        Peter Stockmann. Of course it will be necessary to raise a municipal
        loan.
        
        Hovstad (getting up). Surely you never mean that the town must pay—?
        
        Aslaksen. Do you mean that it must come out of the municipal
        funds?—out of the ill-filled pockets of the small tradesmen?
        
        Peter Stockmann. Well, my dear Mr. Aslaksen, where else is the money to
        come from?
        
        Aslaksen. The gentlemen who own the Baths ought to provide that.
        
        Peter Stockmann. The proprietors of the Baths are not in a position to
        incur any further expense.
        
        Aslaksen. Is that absolutely certain, Mr. Mayor?
        
        Peter Stockmann. I have satisfied myself that it is so. If the town
        wants these very extensive alterations, it will have to pay for them.
        
        Aslaksen. But, damn it all—I beg your pardon—this is quite another
        matter, Mr. Hovstad!
        
        Hovstad. It is, indeed.
        
        Peter Stockmann. The most fatal part of it is that we shall be obliged
        to shut the Baths for a couple of years.
        
        Hovstad. Shut them? Shut them altogether?
        
        Aslaksen. For two years?
        
        Peter Stockmann. Yes, the work will take as long as that—at least.
        
        Aslaksen. I'm damned if we will stand that, Mr. Mayor! What are we
        householders to live upon in the meantime?
        
        Peter Stockmann. Unfortunately, that is an extremely difficult question
        to answer, Mr. Aslaksen. But what would you have us do? Do you suppose
        we shall have a single visitor in the town, if we go about proclaiming
        that our water is polluted, that we are living over a plague spot, that
        the entire town—
        
        Aslaksen. And the whole thing is merely imagination?
        
        Peter Stockmann. With the best will in the world, I have not been able
        to come to any other conclusion.
        
        Aslaksen. Well then I must say it is absolutely unjustifiable of Dr.
        Stockmann—I beg your pardon, Mr. Mayor.
        
        Peter Stockmann. What you say is lamentably true, Mr. Aslaksen. My
        brother has unfortunately always been a headstrong man.
        
        Aslaksen. After this, do you mean to give him your support, Mr. Hovstad?
        
        Hovstad. Can you suppose for a moment that I—?
        
        Peter Stockmann. I have drawn up a short resume of the situation as it
        appears from a reasonable man's point of view. In it I have indicated
        how certain possible defects might suitably be remedied without
        outrunning the resources of the Baths Committee.
        
        Hovstad. Have you got it with you, Mr. Mayor?
        
        Peter Stockmann (fumbling in his pocket). Yes, I brought it with me in
        case you should—
        
        Aslaksen. Good Lord, there he is!
        
        Peter Stockmann. Who? My brother?
        
        Hovstad. Where? Where?</p>
