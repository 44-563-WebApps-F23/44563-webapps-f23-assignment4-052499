    <p>Aslaksen. A politician should never be too certain of anything, Mr.
        Hovstad. And as for you, Mr. Billing, I should think it is time for you
        to be taking in a reef or two in your sails, seeing that you are
        applying for the post of secretary to the Bench.<br>
        
        Billing. I—!<br>
        
        Hovstad. Are you, Billing?<br>
        
        Billing. Well, yes—but you must clearly understand I am only doing it
        to annoy the bigwigs.<br>
        
        Aslaksen. Anyhow, it is no business of mine. But if I am to be accused
        of timidity and of inconsistency in my principles, this is what I want
        to point out: my political past is an open book. I have never changed,
        except perhaps to become a little more moderate, you see. My heart is
        still with the people; but I don't deny that my reason has a certain
        bias towards the authorities—the local ones, I mean. (Goes into the
        printing room.)<br>
        
        Billing. Oughtn't we to try and get rid of him, Hovstad?<br>
        
        Hovstad. Do you know anyone else who will advance the money for our
        paper and printing bill?<br>
        
        Billing. It is an infernal nuisance that we don't possess some capital
        to trade on.<br>
        
        Hovstad (sitting down at his desk). Yes, if we only had that, then—
        
        Billing. Suppose you were to apply to Dr. Stockmann?<br>
        
        Hovstad (turning over some papers). What is the use? He has got nothing.<br>
        
        Billing. No, but he has got a warm man in the background, old Morten
        Kiil—"the Badger," as they call him.<br>
        
        Hovstad (writing). Are you so sure he has got anything?<br>
        
        Billing. Good Lord, of course he has! And some of it must come to the
        Stockmanns. Most probably he will do something for the children, at all
        events.<br>
        
        Hovstad (turning half round). Are you counting on that?<br>
        
        Billing. Counting on it? Of course I am not counting on anything.<br>
        
        Hovstad. That is right. And I should not count on the secretaryship to
        the Bench either, if I were you; for I can assure you—you won't get it.<br>
        
        Billing. Do you think I am not quite aware of that? My object is
        precisely not to get it. A slight of that kind stimulates a man's
        fighting power—it is like getting a supply of fresh bile—and I am
        sure one needs that badly enough in a hole-and-corner place like this,
        where it is so seldom anything happens to stir one up.<br>
        
        Hovstad (writing). Quite so, quite so.<br>
        
        Billing. Ah, I shall be heard of yet!—Now I shall go and write the
        appeal to the Householders' Association. (Goes into the room on the
        right.)<br>
        
        Hovstad (sitting al his desk, biting his penholder, says slowly).
        Hm!—that's it, is it. (A knock is heard.) Come in! (PETRA comes in by
        the outer door. HOVSTAD gets up.) What, you!—here?<br>
        
        Petra. Yes, you must forgive me—<br>
        
        Hovstad (pulling a chair forward). Won't you sit down?<br>
        
        Petra. No, thank you; I must go again in a moment.<br>
        
        Hovstad. Have you come with a message from your father, by any chance?<br>
        
        Petra. No, I have come on my own account. (Takes a book out of her coat
        pocket.) Here is the English story.<br>
        
        Hovstad. Why have you brought it back?<br>
        
        Petra. Because I am not going to translate it.<br>
        
        Hovstad. But you promised me faithfully.<br>
        
        Petra. Yes, but then I had not read it, I don't suppose you have read
        it either?<br>
        
        Hovstad. No, you know quite well I don't understand English; but—<br>
        
        Petra. Quite so. That is why I wanted to tell you that you must find
        something else. (Lays the book on the table.) You can't use this for
        the "People's Messenger."<br>
        
        Hovstad. Why not?<br>
        
        Petra. Because it conflicts with all your opinions.<br>
        
        Hovstad. Oh, for that matter—<br>
        
        Petra. You don't understand me. The burden of this story is that there
        is a supernatural power that looks after the so-called good people in
        this world and makes everything happen for the best in their
        case—while all the so-called bad people are punished.<br>
        
        Hovstad. Well, but that is all right. That is just what our readers
        want.<br>
        
        Petra. And are you going to be the one to give it to them? For myself,
        I do not believe a word of it. You know quite well that things do not
        happen so in reality.<br>
        
        Hovstad. You are perfectly right; but an editor cannot always act as he
        would prefer. He is often obliged to bow to the wishes of the public in
        unimportant matters. Politics are the most important thing in life—for
        a newspaper, anyway; and if I want to carry my public with me on the
        path that leads to liberty and progress, I must not frighten them away.
        If they find a moral tale of this sort in the serial at the bottom of
        the page, they will be all the more ready to read what is printed above
        it; they feel more secure, as it were.<br>
        
        Petra. For shame! You would never go and set a snare like that for your
        readers; you are not a spider!<br>
        
        Hovstad (smiling). Thank you for having such a good opinion of me. No;
        as a matter of fact that is Billing's idea and not mine.<br>
        
        Petra. Billing's!<br>
        
        Hovstad. Yes; anyway, he propounded that theory here one day. And it is
        Billing who is so anxious to have that story in the paper; I don't know
        anything about the book.<br>
        
        Petra. But how can Billing, with his emancipated views—<br>
        
        Hovstad. Oh, Billing is a many-sided man. He is applying for the post
        of secretary to the Bench, too, I hear.<br>
        
        Petra. I don't believe it, Mr. Hovstad. How could he possibly bring
        himself to do such a thing?<br>
        
        Hovstad. Ah, you must ask him that.<br>
        
        Petra. I should never have thought it of him.<br>
        
        Hovstad (looking more closely at her). No? Does it really surprise you
        so much?<br>
        
        Petra. Yes. Or perhaps not altogether. Really, I don't quite know<br>
        
        Hovstad. We journalists are not much worth, Miss Stockmann.<br>
        
        Petra. Do you really mean that?<br>
        
        Hovstad. I think so sometimes.<br>
        
        Petra. Yes, in the ordinary affairs of everyday life, perhaps; I can
        understand that. But now, when you have taken a weighty matter in hand—
        
        Hovstad. This matter of your father's, you mean?<br>
        
        Petra. Exactly. It seems to me that now you must feel you are a man
        worth more than most.<br>
        
        Hovstad. Yes, today I do feel something of that sort.<br>
        
        Petra. Of course you do, don't you? It is a splendid vocation you have
        chosen—to smooth the way for the march of unappreciated truths, and
        new and courageous lines of thought. If it were nothing more than
        because you stand fearlessly in the open and take up the cause of an
        injured man—<br>
        
        Hovstad. Especially when that injured man is—ahem!—I don't rightly
        know how to—<br>
        
        Petra. When that man is so upright and so honest, you mean?<br>
        
        Hovstad (more gently). Especially when he is your father I meant.<br>
        
        Petra (suddenly checked). That?<br>
        
        Hovstad. Yes, Petra—Miss Petra.<br>
        
        Petra. Is it that, that is first and foremost with you? Not the matter
        itself? Not the truth?—not my father's big generous heart?<br>
        
        Hovstad. Certainly—of course—that too.<br>
        
        Petra. No, thank you; you have betrayed yourself, Mr. Hovstad, and now
        I shall never trust you again in anything.<br>
        
        Hovstad. Can you really take it so amiss in me that it is mostly for
        your sake—?<br>
        
        Petra. What I am angry with you for, is for not having been honest with
        my father. You talked to him as if the truth and the good of the
        community were what lay nearest to your heart. You have made fools of
        both my father and me. You are not the man you made yourself out to be.
        And that I shall never forgive you-never!<br>
        
        Hovstad. You ought not to speak so bitterly, Miss Petra—least of all
        now.<br>
        
        Petra. Why not now, especially?<br>
        
        Hovstad. Because your father cannot do without my help.<br>
        
        Petra (looking him up and down). Are you that sort of man too? For
        shame!<br>
        
        Hovstad. No, no, I am not. This came upon me so unexpectedly—you must
        believe that.<br>
        
        Petra. I know what to believe. Goodbye.<br>
        
        Aslaksen (coming from the printing room, hurriedly and with an air of
        mystery). Damnation, Hovstad!—(Sees PETRA.) Oh, this is awkward—<br>
        
        Petra. There is the book; you must give it to some one else. (Goes
        towards the door.)<br>
        
        Hovstad (following her). But, Miss Stockmann—<br>
        
        Petra. Goodbye. (Goes out.)<br>
        
        Aslaksen. I say—Mr. Hovstad—<br>
        
        Hovstad. Well well!—what is it?<br>
        
        Aslaksen. The Mayor is outside in the printing room.<br>
        
        Hovstad. The Mayor, did you say?<br>
        
        Aslaksen. Yes he wants to speak to you. He came in by the back
        door—didn't want to be seen, you understand.<br>
        
        Hovstad. What can he want? Wait a bit—I will go myself. (Goes to the
        door of the printing room, opens it, bows and invites PETER STOCKMANN
        in.) Just see, Aslaksen, that no one—<br>
        
        Aslaksen. Quite so. (Goes into the printing-room.)<br>

        Peter Stockmann. You did not expect to see me here, Mr. Hovstad?<br>
        
        Hovstad. No, I confess I did not.<br>
        
        Peter Stockmann (looking round). You are very snug in here—very nice
        indeed.<br>
        
        Hovstad. Oh—<br>
        
        Peter Stockmann. And here I come, without any notice, to take up your
        time!<br>
        
        Hovstad. By all means, Mr. Mayor. I am at your service. But let me
        relieve you of your—(takes STOCKMANN's hat and stick and puts them on
        a chair). Won't you sit down?<br>
        
        Peter Stockmann (sitting down by the table). Thank you. (HOVSTAD sits
        down.) I have had an extremely annoying experience to-day, Mr. Hovstad.<br>
        
        Hovstad. Really? Ah well, I expect with all the various business you
        have to attend to—<br>
        
        Peter Stockmann. The Medical Officer of the Baths is responsible for
        what happened today.<br>
        
        Hovstad. Indeed? The Doctor?<br>
        
        Peter Stockmann. He has addressed a kind of report to the Baths
        Committee on the subject of certain supposed defects in the Baths.<br>
        
        Hovstad. Has he indeed?<br>
        
        Peter Stockmann. Yes—has he not told you? I thought he said—<br>
        
        Hovstad. Ah, yes—it is true he did mention something about—<br>
        
        Aslaksen (coming from the printing-room). I ought to have that copy.<br>
        
        Hovstad (angrily). Ahem!—there it is on the desk.<br>
        
        Aslaksen (taking it). Right.<br>
        
        Peter Stockmann. But look there—that is the thing I was speaking of!<br>
        
        Aslaksen. Yes, that is the Doctor's article, Mr. Mayor.<br>
        
        Hovstad. Oh, is THAT what you were speaking about?<br>
        
        Peter Stockmann. Yes, that is it. What do you think of it?<br>
        
        Hovstad. Oh, I am only a layman—and I have only taken a very cursory
        glance at it.<br>
        
        Peter Stockmann. But you are going to print it?<br>
